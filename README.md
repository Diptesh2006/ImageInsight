# ImageInsight

Welcome to the **ImageInsight** repository! This project presents a solution for an image classification competition, most likely hosted by the IEEE Computer Society.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Goal:**  
  Classify images into predefined categories using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

- **Features:**  
  - Data loading and preprocessing  
  - Model training with CNN architectures  
  - Evaluation and prediction

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Diptesh2006/Image-Classification-Challenge-_-IEEECS.git
   cd Image-Classification-Challenge-_-IEEECS
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare your dataset**
   - Place your images as required by the scripts or notebooks.

4. **Run**
   - Use the provided Jupyter notebooks or scripts to train and evaluate models.
